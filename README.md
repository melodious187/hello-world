Example git-hub repository 

This is my very first submission into github - cool.

I am learngin more about github for two reasons:
1. This will help me learn one of the industry standard software tools
2. I want to learn more about Stratux, including the newest code written and how to get ad submit code changes

Thank you,
Andrew
